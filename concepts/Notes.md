## Notes on object oriented analysis and design

* **Object**: Represents an entity and basic building block
* **Class**: Blueprint of an object
* **Abstraction**: A way to represent the concept at high level attained by an object
* **Encapsulation**: Binding and hiding the data in an object from external world
* **Inheritance**: Containing the behavior of another object in itself.
* **Polymorphism**: Having multiple form and definition.

The purpose of OO analysis and design can described as:
* Identifying the objects of a system.
* Identifying their relationships.
* Making a design, which can be converted to executables using OO languages.
